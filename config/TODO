- Finish ReturnError and ContinueOnError.
- Implement mandatory parameters (not checked currently).
- Implement multi-values into slices.
- Fix unidentified JSON fields in sub-structures.

Later:

- Custom value parsing via user-supplied function.
- Allow integer values to be entered with commas as 1,000,000.

Possibly:

- Custom config parsing via user-supplied function. 

Suggestions:

- Have "range=min:max" tag?
- Have "split=delimiter" tag that splits value into []string?
