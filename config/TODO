- Fix unidentified JSON fields in sub-structures.
- Implement merged params like -DTV, -xvf, etc.

Later:

- Custom value parsing via user-supplied function.

Possibly:

- Custom config parsing via user-supplied function. 

Suggestions:

- Have "split=delimiter" tag that splits value into []string?
